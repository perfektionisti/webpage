        <p class="about"><b>About me:</b></p>
        <p>Im a 20 year old IT-Engineering student from Finland, mainly focusing on programming.
             <br> I started my studies in the autumn of 2022 after my service for the Finnish military.
             <br>I chose to study in this field because I enjoy partaking in meaningful and challenging work.
             <br>Both of my parents are engineers as well, which further supported my decision.
             <br>I spend my freetime around my hobbies and interests, <br>which mainly consists of climbing and self-improvement.
